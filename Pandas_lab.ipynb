    "This goal of this notebook is to give a introduction to the `pandas` library, a popular data manipulation and analysis tool for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before completing this notebook, you should read the introductory material which is available in you Github Classroom repository or [here](https://github.com/bi-labor/pandas_jupyter/blob/master/notebooks/Pandas_introduction.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems are numbered from **Q1** to **Q5** with many subproblems such as **Q1.1**. The scores range from 2 to 5 based on the difficulty of the problem. The maximum score for each Task is:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Task | Score |\n",
    "| ---- | ----|\n",
    "| 1 | 16 |\n",
    "| 2 | 5 |\n",

    "| 4 | 17 |\n",
    "| 5 | 28 |\n",

    "| -25 | 1 |\n",

    "Task 1 to 4 are considered core exercises.\n",
    "Task 5 contains advanced exercises for higher scores.\n",
    "You can make up for mistakes in Task 1-4.\n",
    "As you can see from the grading table, you don't have to complete all excercises to get a high grade, but we encourage you to work on them. Don't hesitate to contact your lab supervisor if you have any questions regarding the excercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer should go in place of `YOUR CODE HERE`. Please remove `raise NotImplementedError`!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the tasks are automatically graded with [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).\n",
    "There are many visible and hidden tests.\n",
    "Visible tests are available in this version, hidden tests are not.\n",
    "This means that passing all visible tests does not ensure that your answer is correct.\n",
    "Not passing the visible tests means that your answer is incorrect.\n",

    "\n",
    "You only need to submit this notebook through Github Classroom.\n",
    "Please do not add any additional files such as the dataset.\n",
    "Make sure that you commit and push the last version of your notebook.\n",

    "If you skip and exercise, please leave the solution cell as it is and do not remove the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "You generally don't need to leave any DataFrames printed as cell outputs. You can do it for debug purposes and it won't affect the autograder but please don't leave long tables in the output. Use `.head()` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be concise. All exercises can be solved with fewer than 5 lines of code and most are one-liners.\n",
    "\n",
    "All exercises can be solved without for loops. Using a for loop for Q1.6 is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid overriding Python built-in functions with your own variables (e.g. `max = 2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you mess up, you can always do one of the following\n",
    "  1. Kernel -> Restart & Run All - this will run all cells from top to bottom until an exception is thrown\n",
    "  1. Kernel -> Restart, Cell -> Run All Above - this will run all cells from top to bottom until the current cell is reached or and exception is thrown\n",
    "  \n",
    "If your notebook runs for longer than a minute, one or more of your solutions is very inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Please fill out this [short survey](https://forms.gle/jb8D6uqVD3rp9piw8) after you completed the problems."
